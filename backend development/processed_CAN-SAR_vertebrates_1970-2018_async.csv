Develop restoration plans for key colonies: Develop restoration plans for the four suggested administrative areas 
2.        Develop and support programs aimed at reducing threats: Prioritize and implement predator eradication projects at Ancient Murrelet colonies throughout the Canadian breeding range. Ensure that zoning and public land use restrictions currently in place for Ancient Murrelet colonies are actively monitored and enforced. Collaborate with the National Aerial Surveillance Program (NASP) and the Integrated Satellite Tracking of Polluters (ISTOP) to ensure that oiling deterrence measures and oil hotspot mapping are implemented in areas important to Ancient Murrelet, including Haida Gwaii. Collaborate with appropriate jurisdictions to support and improve existing bycatch reduction measures. This may include: placing at-sea observers on boats, exploring opportunities to introduce electronic monitoring systems, and encouraging the investigation of innovative bycatch reduction techniques.
3.        Undertake research and monitoring : Establish baseline monitoring protocols to assess population size and status at each colony location, Investigate and implement cost-effective introduced predator monitoring techniques to track predator activity and ensure that predators are not re-introduced in restored colonies. Conduct further research on attraction and retention of prospecting adults at vacant breeding colonies using social cues. Expand collaboration, research, and monitoring to address information knowledge gaps regarding location and movement of Ancient Murrelets during the non-breeding season. Conduct further research to assess and monitor the effects of oceanographic changes on colonies other than those currently covered by the Laskeek Bay Conservation Society.

Generally findings indicate that aerial invertebrates have lower diversity and abundance in homogenized agricultural landscapes. However, agricultural land is a small component of Black Swift range during breeding. K. Potter suggested that most of the area in the western Amazon basin where swifts from Colorado overwinter has not been developed - and has low road density (dirt roads etc.). There is much more extensive development in the eastern Amazon basin (see maps in Soares-Filho et al. 2006). However, there is a possibility that swifts from Canada overwinter in a different area that is affected by this factor. The other recent sighting of Black Swift in South America was in Tambopata National Reserve in Peru - which is within the kernel areas of the wintering birds from Colorado.",0,,,,,,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,"Although no Black Swifts have apparently been killed by wind turbines, mortality has occurred in other swift species. For example, Vauxs Swifts and White-throated Swifts were killed by wind turbines in Washington and Oregon (Johnson and Erickson 2011). Compared to other bird species (particularly passerines and raptors) the numbers of individuals that would be killed is quite low, perhaps partly because of the height at which swifts generally forage and also because of their flight speeds and maneuverability. Recent information suggests that much larger numbers of birds (and bats) are killed by wind turbines than has previously been estimated (Smallwood 2013). However, compared to other threats to Black Swifts, this would be considered of low impact.",1,,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,"Infrastructure also causes habitat loss and fragmentation which could cumulatively affect invertebrate food supply for swifts. It also affects run-off and thus could affect water supply to swift nesting sites.

It may depend on the type of logging - over time removal of older trees could affect invertebrate numbers, if average stand age decreases. It has been shown that ant nest densities in British Columbia are higher where large wood structures (trees, logs, stumps) occur and since ants are thought to be an important component of Black Swift diet, logging (which reduces wood volume) may have a negative effect. Also there could be an impact on hydrology - increased run-off and pulse events. Initially logging could result in increased volume of stream flow but later flow could dry up. Lack of transpiration is another issue. These could affect stream flow at nest sites (water is a critical component at nesting sites) or invertebrate food supply. Deforestation is occurring on east slopes coastal range in BC. Also in Amazon basin but deforestation here may be an issue over longer term (not next 10 years).",0,,,,,,1,,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,"Human disturbance probably has a neglible impact but important to note that there are different types of disturbance (people walking on trails to rock climbing, caving). Some nest sites may be disturbed by rock climbers or cavers. Although rock climbing could be a threat (Remsen 1978), many nest sites are on wet, slippery and mossy substrates and so dangerous to climb. In Johnston Canyon, Alberta, some nests can be observed at eye level from the trail and swifts remain on the nest despite numerous passers-by (Jason Rogers, pers. comm. 2013). At one site in Johnston Canyon, a stick had apparently been thrown at the nest and was lodged in a crevice (Jason Rogers, pers. comm. 2013). (A thrown rock was reported to have destroyed a nest in southern California (Foerster 1987; Lowther and Collins 2002)). There is a possibility that people using flash photography to take photographs of Black Swifts nestlings could disturb nestlings, especially if they are near to fledging, and they could fall into the creek below (Jason Rogers, pers. comm. 2013). Johnston canyon on its own is only a small percentage of the Canadian population. Human disturbance is not believed to be a a threat to nesting birds here (as 1000s of people a day go through this site and birds seem unaffected).

The consensus was that pesticides could have impact over next 10 years (severe to moderate) but really unknown. It could be as high as 70%, but telecom participants were happier with 'unknown'. Although agriculture occurs in relatively small part of Black Swifts breeding range - airborne pollutants can be detected at great distances from the original source and have impacts over large geographical areas. Despite their different life histories and geographic distributions, aerial insectivores are declining as a group. One common threat that has been identified but not proven is the role of insecticides. In particular there has been concern over the Neonicotinoid insecticides which have extremely high toxicity to invertebrates (e.g., believed to have decimated bee populations; they have also recently been shown to interfere with behaviour of ant species).

If warmer winters result in increased survival this could have knock on effects on insect phenology.

This may not be an issue over next 10 years but will definitely cause issues in the longer term (potential impact will be higher - see climate models). It is questionable whether or not it may be an issue in the next 10 years since the rate of climate change may be increasing. Moreover, there are some data to suggest that phenological changes in response to warming can occur within a relatively short time period. There are also data from some bird species that show that they cannot adapt as rapidly to changes in climate as can invertebrates.",1,-1.0,3.0,-1.0,3.0,effects are likely to be very local (i.e..

Objective 2: Communicate and exchange information on an ongoing basis between parties using a collaborative and coordinated approach.
Objective 3: Collect information to fill knowledge gaps on Dolphin and Union Caribou using IQ and TK, community monitoring and scientific methods.
Objective 4: Minimize disturbance to habitat and preserve sea ice crossings to maintain the ability of Dolphin and Union Caribou to move freely across their range. (Proactively work with marine/industry/transportation organizations and regulators to minimize human and industrial disturbance and seek ways to preserve sea ice crossings. Manage populations of other species that affect Dolphin and Union Caribou habitat.)
Objective 5: Ensure management is based on population level so future generations can benefit from sustainable harvesting opportunities. (Manage harvesting activities within acceptable limits using adaptive management techniques included in Section 6, to ensure that harvesting opportunities are available in the future and treaty rights are fully respected. Manage predators using adaptive management techniques included in Section 6 as a natural and necessary part of the ecosystem. )
Harvest management and other management actions should also be informed by the level and trend of the population. This management plan recommends a framework describing how management actions should be adapted at different phases in the Dolphin and Union Caribou cycle, according to when the population is increasing, high, decreasing or low.
There are already some measures in place that assist in managing Dolphin and Union Caribou, including land claim agreements, legislation, regulations, community conservation plans, and land use planning.
",1,"Research, Monitoring, Mitigate climate change","Improve our overall understanding of Dolphin and Union Caribou health, biology and habitat requirements, diet, and effects of climate change. Some of the threats to Dolphin and Union Caribou such as climate change, pollution and contaminants are broad in scope and cannot be directly addressed by this management plan. Since these range-wide threats are caused by humankind, national and international cooperation and collaboration should be promoted to help mitigate them. The impact of these threats on Dolphin and Union Caribou should be highlighted through the appropriate regional, national and international fora.  In addressing these threats, all management partners will need to work collaboratively and can choose to work on approaches and actions that are most suitable for their particular organisations mandate.

Currently most activity is local ice-breaking activity early season around Cambridge Bay, but occasional ships are passing through so this threat is already occurring. The current proposal for shipping out of the bottom of Bathurst inlet could affect half the D-U population. Impact of shipping depends on timing. Caribou can start crossing as early as October 15 and into December. 2-3 boats during migration could entirely stop migration and cause 40% of the animals to drown.

There may be a shift in harvest from mainland caribou, which are in steep decline. D&U population has declined since the last surveys, but has also changed its distribution such that animals are not so accessible to these communities anymore. This will decrease harvest.

A significant number of individuals would need to be inter-breeding to impact population. Communities have seen Peary caribou traveling with D&U, Barrenground traveling with D&U (more rare).

Activities also highlight the need for habitat restoration. Various stakeholders will  need to be engaged including private and public landowners, land users, planners, non-government and government organizations. Partnerships will need to be developed with willing landowners and conservation groups particularly when considering re-introduction on the mainland. Habitat protection, management and restoration are of the utmost importance to recover Northern Bobwhite, as habitat loss and fragmentation have been the most significant threats to the species. On-going implementation of best management practices to control European Common Reed and other invasive plant species will be needed. Assessing habitat for interspersion of key habitat types and ensuring sufficient quantity and connectivity of habitat, particularly of winter habitat, will be required to guide habitat restoration on Walpole Island First Nation and the mainland. Threat mitigation will be necessary to reduce predation and other causes of mortality and encourage population growth of the remaining population on Walpole Island First Nation and eventually, if feasible, a re-introduced population on the mainland. Outreach and education will be needed to reduce exposure to herbicides and insecticides and encourage ecologically appropriate use of fire on Walpole Island First Nation. Further restriction of game bird hunting preserves on the mainland will need to be considered as locations for habitat restoration and re-introduction are identified and prioritized. Collaboration with agencies and organizations involved in Northern Bobwhite research in the United States will be important to use lessons-learned  from the extensive amount of work completed and underway south of the border. Where technically feasible, further genetic analysis in the form of a monitoring program could provide more insight into the genetic diversity of Northern Bobwhites on Walpole Island First Nation and if necessary birds on the mainland, and also help understand future patterns of population expansion, dispersal behaviour, habitat use and identification of potential sink habitats (Miller et al. 1999; Frankham et al. 2002 in Chabot 2014). It could also help evaluate the need for and scope of a captive breeding and release program, if deemed appropriate and feasible.

Broad strategies to recover Offshore Killer Whale:
monitor the population abundance and demographics of Offshore Killer Whales and refine knowledge of their use of Canadian Pacific waters
ensure that Offshore Killer Whales have an adequate and accessible food supply to allow recovery
ensure that disturbance from human activities does not prevent the recovery of Offshore Killer Whales
ensure that chemical and biological pollutants do not prevent the recovery of Offshore Killer Whale populations
identify critical habitat for designation and protection
The general approaches to support these broad strategies are identified in Table 2. The majority of approaches are to meet the need for foundational knowledge about the Offshore Killer Whale population. Additional approaches support the need to further understand and mitigate the identified anthropogenic and natural threats. Note that these strategies and approaches are complemented by the activities that make up the schedule of studies to identify critical habitat (Table 3).Reduce the introduction of biological pollutants, including pathogens and exotic species, into the habitats of Offshore Killer Whales and their prey",1,Research,"Increase understanding of how climate change might affect Offshore Killer Whales, either directly or indirectly","Outreach and stewardship, Research and monitoring, Habitat management",Research and monitoring,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1.0,0,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,0,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,"a floating bridge represent a ""psychological barrier",,,,,,1,,,,,,0,,,,,,1,,,,,,0,,,,,,1,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,1,,,,,,,0,,,,,,1,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,1,,,,,,0,,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,mammal

Note that over a 30-year window, some areas may have a period of improved habitat (with better access to prey), though this is debated because Ringed Seal are long-lived species and it may take years for populations in low density areas on multi-year ice environments to increase to stable levels on thinner ice.

There is also a summer camp and new gravel beds near Mesachie Creek, but this is less important habitat (larvae are rarely found there). In Cowichan Lake, there is development in the southeastern portion of the lake, affecting spawning and rearing habitat near Sutton Creek and Meades Creek. The spawning and rearing habitat along the northwest shoreline does not appear to be strongly affected by development. Overall, we estimate about 11-30% of the population may be threatened by changes to spawning and rearing habitat in developed areas.

Persecution of Vancouver Lamprey - All of most Vancouver Lamprey adults are potentially affected by persecution by anglers in Cowichan and Mesachie lakes. Severity:Consumptive use of host species - Coho Salmon escapement from Cowichan Lake has decreased approximately 73% since the 1950s. Overfishing may contribute to this decline, although decreased survival of Coho at sea also contributes. In other parasitic lamprey species, lamprey abundance declines with declines in host availability. However, we do not know exactly how much the Vancouver Lamprey population varies with availability of Coho Salmon. Ability to switch to other hosts (e.g., Cutthroat Trout) may provide a buffer. Persecution of Vancouver Lamprey - Angler-induced mortality is thought to be high (i.e., of those caught attached to fish), but the total number of lamprey killed by anglers is unknown and likely relatively low or low-moderate. Timing:Consumptive use of host species - Although Coho Salmon in Cowichan Lake have not been monitored since 2006, the decline in Coho (relative to their historical abundance) appears to be ongoing. Persecution of Vancouver Lamprey - Killing of Vancouver Lamprey adults by anglers is an ongoing threat. Persecution and bycatch accounted for here but host persecution is accounted for 6.3. persecution is not a threat for this species since anglers are not targetting Lampreys.

Severity: There are buffer zones in between forestry areas and the shoreline, which should reduce impact on lamprey habitat. Atlthough forestry has historically increased siltation in these lakes, the increase in siltation due to forestry is likely minimal at present. As well, although increased siltation could reduce spawning habitat, it could increase larval habitat, which could reduce overall negative effects.

Maintain at least 90% of the genetic diversity, as measured by allelic diversity, within the Wood Bison subspecies and local recovery populations for the next 200 years. Increase potential for connectivity among isolated local free-ranging, disease-free populations, and for population expansion (after the risk of brucellosis and tuberculosis transmission has been eliminated).

Increase public awareness and acceptance for Wood Bison, including acknowledging and augmenting social, cultural, ecological, and economic relationships among Wood Bison and Indigenous peoples and local communities.
        More info : A Bison Disease Technical Workshop was held in 2005 to examine the technical feasibility of eliminating bovine diseases from the Wood Buffalo National Park ecosystem (Shury et al. 2006). Studies have been completed on vaccines for Brucella abortus in both bison and cattle (Clapp et al. 2011, Treanor et al. 2010, Denisov et al. 2010, Hu et al. 2009, 2010), and studies are being planned to look at effectiveness of vaccine for tuberculosis in bison. Develop a contingency plan for disease and genetic management in the event a disease-free local population becomes infected with bovine tuberculosis and/or brucellosis Several reintroduced free-ranging local populations (Aishihik, Hay Zama, Mackenzie) currently have highly managed hunts, where quotas are determined by the province/territory for both the Indigenous and non-Indigenous hunts. Quotas are based on herd population dynamics and socioeconomic factors to manage herd expansion and increase public acceptance. Recommendations for use of fire in the management of Wood Bison have been proposed (Fort Nelson First Nation and Shifting Mosaics Consulting 2015). Manage genetic integrity by preventing free-ranging Plains Bison, domestic bison, and cattle from hybridizing with Wood Bison through controlling, eliminating and/or preventing incursion of these animals into areas with Wood Bison. ~4,363 Wood Bison in nine free-ranging, disease-free local populations plus 300 individuals in one public, captive, disease-free local population managed for conservation.
