## Team Contribution Statement

- Jensen Huang:

- Jensen was primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the data visualizations. He led the creation of the prototype figures, selected appropriate visualization techniques, and ensured that the visual design aligned with both aesthetic and interaction principles discussed in class. He also contributed to the literature review, identifying and citing relevant scholarly sources.

- Cody Qin:

- Cody focused on data sourcing, cleaning, and integration. He identified datasets aligned with FAIR/CARE principles, handled data preprocessing, and developed scripts to merge and structure the data for analysis. Cody also played a key role in tool selection and setting up the GitHub repository to ensure reproducibility.

- Loe Bi:

- Loe led the writing and editing of the research proposal. He structured the document, refined the research questions, and ensured clarity and coherence throughout the text. In addition, he created the innovation flowchart to visualize the project pipeline and collaborated with the team to ensure alignment between the research goals, tools, and audience.
