<!-- ### Key Goals & Features -->
<!-- 
- **Integrate Data:** Combine comprehensive species-at-risk details (CAN-SAR) with long-term population trend data (CSI).
- **Correlate Status & Trends:** Analyze how official SARA designations (Special Concern, Threatened, Endangered) align with observed population changes since 1970.
- **Identify Delays:** Investigate potential time lags between population declines and subsequent conservation status changes.
- **Examine Differential Outcomes:** Explore variations in trends across different taxonomic groups (mammals, fish, etc.) and ecosystems (terrestrial, freshwater, marine).
- **Effective Communication:** Develop interactive visualizations tailored to policymakers and wildlife managers, leveraging affective visualization principles to enhance understanding and engagement.
- **Open Science:** Ensure reproducibility by adhering to FAIR principles, using structured data (CSV), and hosting analysis code and visualizations openly on GitHub. -->

### Methodology & Approach

This project integrates the two datasets described above to perform a correlational analysis between conservation status designations and population trajectories. Our approach involves:

1.  **Data Sourcing & Preprocessing:** Identifying, cleaning, and structuring data from CAN-SAR and CSI according to FAIR/CARE principles.
2.  **Data Integration:** Merging the datasets based on species identifiers to link status information with population trends.
3.  **Analysis:** Statistically examining the correlation between status changes and population trends, identifying potential leads or lags, and comparing outcomes across groups.
4.  **Visualization:** Developing interactive visualizations using techniques designed for clarity and impact, including principles of affective visualization to better communicate urgency and ecological realities to the target audience. -->
