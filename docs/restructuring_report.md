# Development Report: Project Structure Refinement

This report details the changes made to the project structure to enhance organization and professionalism. The primary goal was to consolidate the various components (frontend, backend, data processing, and mock visualization) into a more logical and streamlined directory structure.

## Changes Implemented:

### 1. React Application Relocation:

The React application, previously located in the `app/` directory, has been moved to the project root. This involved relocating:
- Core configuration files (`.gitignore`, `eslint.config.js`, `index.html`, `package-lock.json`, `package.json`, `postcss.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, `tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`, `vite.config.ts`)
- Public assets (`public/` directory)
- Source code (`src/` directory)
- Project-level documentation (`README.md` and `docs/` directory)

Each of these moves was accompanied by a dedicated Git commit to track the changes. Path references within the frontend files were reviewed and updated where necessary (though most were relative and did not require modification).

### 2. Backend Consolidation:

The contents of the `backend development/` directory have been consolidated into a new `backend/` directory at the project root.
- Core Python application files (`app.py`, `load_data.py`, `wsgi.py`) were moved to `backend/`.
- A `requirements.txt` file was created in `backend/` to list the necessary Python dependencies (`flask`, `flask_sqlalchemy`, `flask_cors`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `sqlalchemy`).
- Backend-specific documentation and setup scripts (`api_documentation.md`, `backend_configuration_report.md`, `deployment_guide.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, `setup_server.sh`, `species-api.service`) were moved into a new `docs/backend/` directory for better organization of project documentation.
- A Python virtual environment (`.venv`) was created within the `backend/` directory, and the dependencies from `requirements.txt` were installed to ensure a clean and isolated environment for the backend.

### 3. Data Processing Script Consolidation:

The data processing script and its related files, previously in `data processing/`, have been moved and organized.
- The main data processing script (`data_process.py`) and its `requirements.txt` file were moved to a new `scripts/` directory at the root, intended for standalone scripts.
- The readme file (`readme.md`) from `data processing/` was moved to a new `docs/data-processing/` directory to keep it alongside other project documentation.

### 4. Data File Consolidation:

Data files (`.csv`) that were present in both `backend development/` and `data processing/` have been consolidated into a single `data/` directory at the project root.
- Duplicate `.csv` files were identified and removed, keeping one copy of each in the `data/` directory.
- Paths within the `backend/load_data.py` script were updated to correctly reference the data files in their new `data/` location.

### 5. Removal of Obsolete Directories:

The following directories, which are now empty or have had their relevant contents relocated, have been removed:
- `mock_visualization/` (as it was identified as potentially obsolete)
- `backend development/`
- `data processing/`

These changes result in a flatter, more organized project structure with clear separation of concerns between the frontend, backend, scripts, data, and documentation.
