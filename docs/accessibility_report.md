# Development Report: Accessibility Improvements

## Overview

This report details the accessibility improvements implemented in the Canadian Species Data Visualization web application, with a particular focus on enhancing usability for users with color vision deficiencies and improving compatibility with assistive technologies.

## Objective

The primary objective was to improve the overall accessibility of the application, addressing common accessibility issues and specifically considering the needs of colorblind users in data visualizations.

## Implemented Improvements

The following accessibility improvements have been implemented:

### 1. Colorblind-Friendly Color Palettes

- **Canada Map (`src/components/map/CanadaMap.tsx`):** Replaced the original sequential color scale used for province coloring with a colorblind-friendly sequential palette (Viridis-like) to ensure better differentiation of species density levels for users with various forms of colorblindness.
- **Pie Chart (`src/components/charts/PieChart.tsx`):** Updated the default categorical color palette to a colorblind-friendly categorical palette (Tol Vibrant) for better distinction between pie chart segments.
- **Bar, Composed, and Line Charts (`src/components/charts/BarChart.tsx`, `src/components/charts/ComposedChart.tsx`, `src/components/charts/LineChart.tsx`):** Added the colorblind-friendly categorical color palette as a constant within these components for reference, encouraging the use of this palette when defining colors for bars and lines.

### 2. Alternative Visual Cues for Lines

- **Line Chart (`src/components/charts/LineChart.tsx`) and Composed Chart (`src/components/charts/ComposedChart.tsx`):** Added an optional `lineStyle` property to the line configuration interfaces and implemented the `strokeDasharray` prop using predefined dash array patterns. This allows for differentiating lines using varying styles (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.) in addition to color, providing an alternative visual cue for users who cannot distinguish between certain colors.

### 3. Screen Reader and Keyboard Navigation Enhancements

- **Header (`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`):** Added `aria-label="Main navigation"` to the `<nav>` element to provide a clear and descriptive label for screen reader users.
- **Layout (`src/components/layout/Layout.tsx`):** Implemented a visually hidden skip-to-main content link that becomes visible on keyboard focus. This allows keyboard users to quickly navigate past the header and directly to the main content area, improving navigation efficiency. The main content area (`<main>` element) was given an `id="main-content"` to serve as the target for this link.
- **Navigation (`src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx`):** Added `aria-hidden="true"` to the decorative SVG icons within the "Previous" and "Next" navigation links. This prevents screen readers from announcing the presence of these icons, which are redundant to the link text.

## Files Modified

The following files were modified during this accessibility improvement phase:

- `src/components/map/CanadaMap.tsx`
- `src/components/charts/PieChart.tsx`
- `src/components/charts/BarChart.tsx`
- `src/components/charts/ComposedChart.tsx`
- `src/components/charts/LineChart.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/Layout.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx`
- `tsconfig.app.json` (to fix unrelated TypeScript errors encountered during the process)

## Remaining Areas for Improvement

While significant accessibility improvements have been made, further enhancements could include:

- **Color Contrast Review:** Conduct a comprehensive review of all text and interactive elements to ensure sufficient color contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 AA or AAA standards. This may involve adjusting existing Tailwind CSS classes or adding custom styles.
- **Focus Indicator Visibility:** Verify that focus indicators for all interactive elements are clearly visible and meet accessibility requirements.
- **Alternative Text for Images:** Ensure all informative images have appropriate alternative text.
- **Keyboard Accessibility Testing:** Thoroughly test keyboard navigation and interaction for all components and workflows.

This report summarizes the accessibility work completed. The implemented changes aim to make the Canadian Species Data Visualization application more inclusive and usable for a wider audience.
