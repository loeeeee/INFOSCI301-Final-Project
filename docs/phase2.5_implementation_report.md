# Phase 2.5 Implementation Report: Provincial Map Improvements

## Overview

This report details the implementation of Phase 2.5 of the Canadian Species Data Visualization Web App project. Phase 2.5 focused on addressing specific issues with the Provincial Map section that were identified after Phase 2, enhancing usability and visualization clarity.

## Problems Addressed

Phase 2.5 tackled three key issues with the Provincial Map component:

1. **Excessive Zoom Level**: The default zoom level was too high, making it difficult to view the full choropleth map. This limited users' ability to get an overview of conservation data across all provinces.

2. **Excessive Map Size**: The map occupied too much vertical space on the page, leaving little room for detailed data visualization below it.

3. **Uninformative Conservation Actions Data**: The previous implementation displayed "NE" (Not Evaluated) conservation actions data that wasn't informative and didn't vary across provinces.

## Implementation Solutions

### 1. Optimized Map View

The map visualization was adjusted to provide a better overview of all Canadian provinces and territories:

- Reduced the default zoom level from 1.2 to 0.6
- Decreased the map projection scale from 700 to 450
- Adjusted the center coordinates for better positioning
- These changes provide a comprehensive view of the entire Canadian map at a glance

```jsx
// Modified ZoomableGroup and projection scale in CanadaMap.tsx
<ComposableMap
  projection="geoMercator"
  projectionConfig={{ scale: 450 }} // Reduced from 700
  width={width}
  height={height}
>
  <ZoomableGroup center={[-97, 60]} zoom={0.6}> {/* Reduced from 1.2 */}
    {/* Map content */}
  </ZoomableGroup>
</ComposableMap>
```

### 2. Improved Layout and Space Utilization

The layout was reorganized to make better use of vertical space:

- Reduced the map height from 600px to 400px
- Moved province details below the map instead of using a side panel
- Added visual hierarchy with background colors and spacing
- This approach maximizes the horizontal space and provides a natural reading flow

```jsx
// Updated map container in MapPage.tsx
<div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <CanadaMap 
    onProvinceClick={handleProvinceClick}
    width={800} 
    height={400} // Reduced height
  />
</div>

{/* Province details displayed below the map */}
{provinceData && <ProvinceDetails province={provinceData} />}
```

### 3. Enhanced Data Visualization

The province detail panel was completely redesigned to provide more meaningful insights:

- Redesigned the province detail section to show clearer insights
- Replaced the uninformative "Conservation Actions" bar chart with a more useful pie chart showing species status proportion
- Increased chart heights from 180px to 240px to improve readability
- Added visual containers with background colors to separate different data sections

```jsx
// Improved visualization components in ProvinceDetails
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 mb-8">
  <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded">
    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Status Distribution</h3>
    <BarChart
      data={statusData}
      bars={[
        { dataKey: 'count', name: 'Count', color: '#FF6B6B' },
      ]}
      xAxisDataKey="status"
      height={240} // Increased height
      rotateLabels={true}
      showLabels={true}
    />
  </div>

  <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded">
    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Status Proportion</h3>
    <div className="h-[240px] flex justify-center items-center">
      <PieChart
        data={statusPieData}
        dataKey="value"
        nameKey="name"
        colors={COLORS}
        height={240}
      />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 4. Province Code Detection Improvements

To ensure reliable display of province data when clicking on the map, the province code detection system was enhanced:

- Implemented more robust province code detection from the GeoJSON data
- Added fallback mechanisms when codes aren't explicitly available
- This ensures reliable display of province data when clicking on the map

```jsx
// Added robust province code detection in CanadaMap.tsx
const getProvinceCode = (geo: any): string => {
  // Check if geo.properties.code exists, otherwise try to extract from name
  if (geo.properties.code && typeof geo.properties.code === 'string') {
    return geo.properties.code;
  }
  
  // If code is not available, try to match from the province name
  const name = geo.properties.name || "";
  for (const [code, provinceName] of Object.entries(PROVINCE_CODES)) {
    if (name.includes(provinceName) || provinceName.includes(name)) {
      return code;
    }
  }
  
  // Additional fallback mechanisms
  // ...
};
```

## Technical Implementation Details

The implementation required updates to the following files:

1. `src/components/map/CanadaMap.tsx` - Modified map projection, zoom level, and province code detection
2. `src/pages/MapPage.tsx` - Redesigned the layout and visualization components
3. The implementation preserved all the valuable data visualization while making it more accessible and easier to interpret

## Results

The Phase 2.5 improvements successfully address all identified issues:

1. **Improved Map Overview**: Users can now see all provinces and territories at once when the map loads
2. **Better Space Utilization**: The reduced map height allows more room for detailed information
3. **More Meaningful Visualizations**: The visualization components now provide clearer insights about species status across provinces
4. **Reliable Province Selection**: The enhanced province code detection ensures users can click on any province and see the corresponding data

## Conclusion

Phase 2.5 has significantly enhanced the user experience of the Provincial Conservation Overview section. These focused improvements allow users to better understand and interact with conservation data across Canadian provinces and territories, advancing the overall goals of the Canadian Species Data Visualization Web App project.
